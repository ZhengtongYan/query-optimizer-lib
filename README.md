# query-optimizer-lib
Contains implementations of various algorithms for database query optimization. The algorithms cover multiple problem variants (e.g., traditional and multi-objective query optimization) and offer various tradeoffs between optimality guarantees and optimization time (e.g., various randomized algorithms, approximation schemes, exhaustive algorithms, parallel algorithms, ...).
